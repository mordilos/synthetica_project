# synthetica_project
synthetica - mid level backend software engineering opening assignment

The application is in "0.0.0.0:5000/characters", the page that shows all characters from the first three movies

In order to get all the characters from the movie of your choice (e.g. x) you can add "/films/x/" after the application front page ("0.0.0.0:5000/characters").

So if you want to get the characters that took part in the first movie, for example, you should reach for "0.0.0.0:5000/characters/films/1/".

In order to start the application, you should go to the root of the project and use the "docker-compose up" command!
